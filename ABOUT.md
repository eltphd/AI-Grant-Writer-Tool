# About AI Grant Writer Tool

AI Grant Writer Tool condenses best-practice grant development workflows into a single, AI-enhanced workspace.

## Why?

Grant writing is time-consuming and highly competitive. By blending Retrieval-Augmented Generation with specialised LLM agents we provide instant, context-aware suggestions that dramatically cut drafting time while improving proposal quality.

## What’s inside?

• **LLM Agents** – Microsoft AutoGen orchestrates multi-step reasoning  
• **RAG Pipeline** – Documents stored as pgvector embeddings inside PostgreSQL enable precise semantic retrieval  
• **API Layer** – FastAPI delivers a typed, async JSON API; Streamlit offers rich data exploration tools  
• **Front-End** – React + Material-UI shipping a cohesive, accessible UI  
• **Dev Experience** – Single Docker Compose file, hot-reload everywhere, zero-to-first-draft in < 5 min
