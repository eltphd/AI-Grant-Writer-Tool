"""Minimal placeholder for auto‑generation utilities.

This module defines stub functions that mimic the interface expected
by the FastAPI endpoints for retrieval‑augmented generation and
AutoGen chat functionality.  In the original AI Grant Writer
application these functions would coordinate with an AutoGen system
to construct proxy agents, run group chats and answer questions
with context.  To keep this repository self‑contained and prevent
import errors, the functions implemented here return simple
placeholders.

You should replace these implementations with your own logic for
retrieval‑augmented generation, multi‑agent coordination and
question answering when integrating your language model.
