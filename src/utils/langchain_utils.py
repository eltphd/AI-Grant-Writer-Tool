"""Minimal placeholder for Langchain utilities.

This module provides a stub implementation of the functions used by
the FastAPI service when generating embeddings or interacting with a
language model via LangChain.  Because the full LangChain library
and your fine‑tuned model are not included in this repository, the
functions here return dummy values to allow the API to run without
import errors.  You should replace these stubs with calls to your
actual embedding model or language chain when you integrate
advanced functionality.

    In a full implementation this function would call OpenAI's
